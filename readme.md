Hello,

This is code I wrote to add features and fix issues with the work system.

How to use:
- Get User JavaScript and CSS exension.
- Go to system homepage
- Add rule, make sure url uses '*' after the last directory separator
- Paste code from inject.js into js side.

Alternate way to use:
- Get User JavaScript and CSS exension.
- Go to system homepage
- Add rule, make sure url uses '*' after the last directory separator
- Paste code from 'recom-patches' into js side.
