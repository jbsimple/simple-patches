Hello,

This is code I wrote to add features and fix issues with the work system.

How to use:
- Get [User JavaScript and CSS extension.](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld?hl=en)
- Go to system homepage
- Add rule, make sure url uses '*' after the last directory separator
- Paste code from inject.js into js side.

Alternate way to use:
- Get [User JavaScript and CSS extension.](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld?hl=en)
- Go to system homepage
- Add rule, make sure url uses '*' after the last directory separator
- Paste code from 'recom-patches.js' into js side.
